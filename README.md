# VersoGameEngine
Hello, I am making a 2D game engine for windows only, this is my first game engine so don't expect this to be commercially ready to make commercial games but if you are interested in looking at it for educational purposes then go ahead.

When planning this engine I made a Miro board, it contains all my thoughts and in depth explanations of my systems ---> https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIoe3ftg=/?share_link_id=809868891606
